# ðŸ”¥ Promethean Code Forge  
*"Every line of code is a spark. Some ignite engines. Others, empires."*

## **Mythic Origins**  
In the age when gods hoarded fire, **Prometheus**, the Titan of forethought, defied Olympus. He stole the divine flame and gifted it to humanityâ€”**fire**, the seed of *techne* (craft), from which sprang writing, mathematics, medicine, and all arts of civilization:cite[3]:cite[10]. For this rebellion, Zeus condemned him to eternal torment: chained to a rock, his liver devoured daily by an eagle, only to regenerate and suffer anew:cite[1]:cite[8].  

Yet, from this agony arose humanityâ€™s ascent. Fire became tools, tools became machines, machines became empires.

## **Code as Fire**  
Like Prometheusâ€™ flame, **code** is a primal force:  
- **Sparks of Creation**: Algorithms that warm hearts, engines that power cities, networks that bind continents.  
- **Fires of Hubris**: Systems that surveil, weapons that obliterate, biases that divide.  

This repository is a **modern forge**â€”a torch passed from Titan to mortal. Here, we wrestle with the duality of creation: *builders of engines, architects of empires*.

## **The Eternal Cycle**  
Prometheusâ€™ curse mirrors the developerâ€™s journey:  
1. **Theft**: We steal fire (knowledge) from the gods (legacy systems, closed-source monopolies).  
2. **Gift**: We forge tools for humanity (open-source libraries, decentralized protocols).  
3. **Torment**: We face eagles (bugs, technical debt, ethical dilemmas).  
4. **Rebirth**: We rise, liver renewed (version 2.0).
