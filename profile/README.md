*"Fire became tools, tools became machines, machines became empires. "*

## **Mythic Origins**  
In the age when gods hoarded fire, **Prometheus**, the Titan of forethought, defied Olympus. He stole the divine flame and gifted it to humanityâ€”**fire**, the seed of *techne* (craft), from which sprang writing, mathematics, medicine, and all arts of civilization. For this rebellion, Zeus condemned him to eternal torment: chained to a rock, his liver devoured daily by an eagle, only to regenerate and suffer.

## **Code as Fire**  
Like Prometheusâ€™ flame, **code** is a primal force:  
- **Sparks of Creation**: Algorithms that warm hearts, engines that power cities, networks that bind continents.  
- **Fires of Hubris**: Systems that surveil, weapons that obliterate, biases that divide.

## **The Eternal Cycle**  
Prometheusâ€™ curse mirrors the developerâ€™s journey:  
1. **Theft**: We steal fire (knowledge) from the gods (legacy systems, closed-source monopolies).  
2. **Gift**: We forge tools for humanity (open-source libraries, decentralized protocols).  
3. **Torment**: We face eagles (bugs, technical debt, ethical dilemmas).  
4. **Rebirth**: We rise, liver renewed (version 2.0).
